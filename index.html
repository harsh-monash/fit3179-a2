                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Victoria's population is growing and changing - not just in size, but in its age and cultural makeup. This dashboard visualises key demographic patterns across Victorian regions and LGAs to highlight how communities differ in age structure, diversity, and population distribution. Together, these visualisations provide a snapshot of where Victorians live, how old they are, and how population characteristics vary across the state.</p>
                <p>The first visual compares the total male and female populations across Victoria's main metropolitan regions. Each bar represents the total population of a region, divided into male (blue) and female (red) segments. This allows quick comparison of regional population size and gender balance, revealing that Southern and Northern areas have the largest and most balanced populations, while inner metropolitan areas are smaller and younger on average.</p>

            <h3>Choropleth Map</h3>
            <div class="chart-container full" id="map"></div>
            <p>The choropleth map visualises the spatial distribution of median age across Victorian LGAs, providing clear geographic context to population structure. A distinct pattern emerges - Eastern and Southern LGAs, such as Mornington Peninsula, Boroondara, and Whitehorse, display higher median ages, reflecting established, family-oriented or retirement-heavy communities. In contrast, Western and Northern suburbs, including Wyndham, Melton, and Hume, exhibit younger median ages, consistent with areas of recent population growth and higher proportions of young families and migrants. This spatial divide highlights how age demographics align with Melbourne's urban expansion, where outer-metro growth corridors attract younger, more diverse populations, while inner and coastal regions maintain older age profiles.</p>

        <section>
            <p>The scatter plot compares each LGA's median age with its total population, revealing how age structure relates to population concentration across Victoria. A clear inverse relationship emerges - larger LGAs tend to have lower median ages, indicating that population growth is strongest in younger, outer-metro areas such as Casey, Wyndham, and Melton. These regions combine rapid housing development, high family formation, and migrant inflows, resulting in youthful demographic profiles.</p>
            <p>Conversely, smaller LGAs with older populations, like Boroondara, Mornington Peninsula, and Whitehorse, cluster toward higher median ages, reflecting mature or established communities with slower growth. The regional colour grouping also reinforces this trend: Western and Northern LGAs are predominantly youthful and high-growth, while Eastern and Southern regions are older and more settled. Overall, the chart highlights Melbourne's demographic gradient â€” from youthful expansion in the outer suburbs to ageing stability in inner and coastal regions.</p>

            <p>The bar charts compare the top 15 birth countries of overseas-born Victorians in 2011 and 2016, illustrating the rapid diversification of Victoria's migrant population. While England remains the largest source country, its dominance has declined relative to fast-growing migrant groups from India and China, both of which expanded significantly between 2011 and 2016. Southeast and South Asian nations such as Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and the Philippines also feature prominently, reflecting strong migration links driven by education and family settlement. The shift underscores Victoria's evolving multicultural landscape - transitioning from traditional European migration toward a more diverse, Asia-centred demographic composition.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Together, these visualisations reveal how Victoria's population is shaped by age, growth, and diversity across regions. The gender balance remains steady statewide, but age and cultural composition vary sharply by location. Younger, fast-growing outer suburbs like Wyndham, Casey, and Melton attract new families and recent migrants, driving population expansion and cultural diversity. Meanwhile, older, established Eastern and Southern LGAs maintain slower growth and higher median ages, reflecting mature and long-settled communities.</p>
            <p>Overall, Victoria's demographic story is one of dynamic contrast - a state balancing ageing populations in traditional areas with youthful energy and diversity in emerging growth corridors, illustrating the evolving social and cultural fabric of modern Melbourne.</p>
